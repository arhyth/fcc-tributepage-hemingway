                The <b>Iceberg Theory</b> (sometimes known as the <b>theory of omission</b>) is a style of writing (turned colloquialism) 
                coined by American writer Ernest Hemingway. As a young journalist, Hemingway had to focus his newspaper reports on immediate events, 
                with very little context or interpretation. When he became a writer of short stories, he retained this minimalistic style, 
                focusing on surface elements without explicitly discussing underlying themes. Hemingway believed the deeper meaning of a story should not be evident on the surface, 
                but should shine through implicitly. <a class="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg_Theory">[Wikipedia]</a>

                “I read one book. Had he any other book apart from that one, littly mattered. It was complete. 
                The weird thing is I can't even remember the names of the characters anymore.
                And yet to this day, after more than a decade from the only time I read it, 
                I remember clearly what it told me:<br>
                Live. That is courage enough.”
